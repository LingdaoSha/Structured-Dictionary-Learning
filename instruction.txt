% Instructions for use of structure preserved color normalization toolbox:
 
Note: We suggest to choose the "wise" target for normalization

1. Run the CN_main file (which is nicely organized) for the demo and 
to see corresponding result output by different color normalization techniques

2. We recommend the default parameter settings.

3. For changing the parameters, go to file (estW.m). Here, you can tune 
lambda sparsity parameter (in publication), no. of stains (nstains). If you feel that 
stain separation is not nice, you can change number of patches sampled (npatches), and patchsize.
